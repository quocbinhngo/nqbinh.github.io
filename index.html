              To prepare for the first day of meetings, the club needs a person
              responsible for the program of the meeting. As the club's
              vice-president, I took on this assignment.
            </p>
            <p class="experience-description experience-description-list-intro">
              My assignment consists of 2 parts:
            </p>
            <ul class="experience-description-list">
              <li>
                Designing game stations: Since there will be a lot of students
                attending, events need to have several game stations for all
                players to enjoy.
              </li>
              <li>
                Coordination of personnel: Since our club has about 15 members,
                we need more volunteers to operate on the first day of the
                meeting. So I had to deal with the lack of human resources.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="experience-description">
              To deal with the first task, after several days of planning with
              other members of the program departments, I called all the club's
              members to test our game. After playing, I calculated the time for
              each game and how many admins we needed for each station. With all
              that in mind, I and some of the program staff planned the time for
              the entire event.
            </p>
            <p class="experience-description">
              Moving on to the remaining mission, I asked some of my classmates
              to help manage the play station. Then I walk them through the
              game's rules for which they are responsible, including how to
              score each team, what message they should give the team leaders
              after the station is over, and so on.
            </p>
            <p class="experience-description">
              I have completed my plans to prepare for the first club event of
              the school year. Unfortunately, due to a lack of experience, the
              progress could not go as I expected. The biggest mistake was me
              because I miscalculated the actual time of each play station.
              However, the programming department had some contingencies for
              this situation, and our first meeting ended well.
            </p>
            <p class="experience-description">
              Looking back, I cherish this opportunity as it was my first time
              hosting a school-scale event. On this occasion, I learned many
              basic definitions of project management, such as timeline,
              contingency plan, etc. Furthermore, I understand that the more
              players in one turn, the better the player's experience. Next, I
              have more experience in planning and coordinating an event, how to
              organize it successfully. Last but not least, I could improve my
              negotiation skills by asking a classmate to help me manage the
              game station. This helps me a lot when I'm choosing people to
              collaborate with on group projects.

            <p class="experience-description">
              In the last year being a student, 12CL1 (the Physics class at LHP
              High School) wanted to have impressive achievements. In the
              previous 2 years, they lost a lot of time time experimenting and
              getting use to the life in Le Hong Phong. And the school flashmob
              contest must be the most considerable opportunity for us to make
              our dream come true. But who will accompany us, since the majority
              of class members are male, and they could not efficiently perform
              any dance on stage? That was the most major problem we could face
              until we cooperated with 10CV2 (LHP High School Literature class).
            </p>
            <p class="experience-description">
              Being a part of this collective and having experience at this
              school, I had to guide newbies on the way to having a fundamental
              shift when they became a part of Le Hong Phong High School.
              Furthermore, I gave them some practical advice about subjects and
              lectures to help them to have good academic performance while
              attending outside activities.
            </p>
            <p class="experience-description">
              For example, to ensure the progress of our training, I usually
              completed the majority of logistic tasks, such as preparing water
              and snacks before every training session. Moreover, after training
              time, I gave some hints for them to deal with their Physics and
              Mathematics problems, which were very difficult for girls
              specializing in Literature. Ensuring their performance inside and
              outside class was very crucial for the class 12CL1 in general, and
              me in particular because with good academic performance, they
              would not have any worry about anything during the practice . This
              would improve our training efficiency, a solid foundation for us
              to do our best in the main contest.
            </p>
            <p class="experience-description">
              I realized that my ability to convey academic knowledge has been
              improving. Furthermore, I understood more clearly how to treat
              women and effectively work with them. Last but not least, these
              girls could alleviate their anxiety about the terrible amount of
              homework that they suffered from after each class. Therefore, we
              could stay at school until 8:00 PM to prepare for our repertoire
              before the contest happened. Finally, the third prize was a
              well-deserved reward for us after two months of hard practice.
            </p>
            <p class="experience-description">
              I believe that being able to know what things are the main points
              during teaching is crucial. Hence, I can convey my idea more
              effectively during discussing academic problems with my teachers
              and peer. Although the final school contest ended, we often had
              some talk share our story in life. Hopefully, we can have an
              opportunity to collaborate again.

            <p class="experience-description">
              In my 11 grade, I was selected to be the offical member of HCM
              team to compete at the national Merit Competition for Outstanding
              Student in Physics.
            </p>
            <p class="experience-description">
              With the honor of the school in general and myself in particular,
              I had to prepare for the main contest in 2.5 months. Therefore, I
              needed to strategize under my learning process to get the best
              performance in the competition.
            </p>
            <p class="experience-description">
              Although this is a nationwide competition, it is important to
              review the entire basic knowledge in the textbook, because if you
              did not understand a small part of the knowledge, the acquisition
              of Advanced physics knowledge would be very time-consuming.
              Therefore, I consulted with several teachers in charge of the
              group of gifted students to ask them what approach would be most
              appropriate to deal with my situation. Then I build a plan with
              Trello to track all study progress. This is very necessary because
              I only have 2.5 months to learn a large amount of physics
              knowledge in the 11th and 12th grades, even in the curriculum of
              higher education levels. To complete this task, I ask not only for
              the support of my teachers but also for my teammates, who were
              former high school students and had experience in participating in
              national competitions. At the end of the week, after the last
              class of the week, we often go to the coffee shop near my school
              to review all the assignments completed for the week.
            </p>
            <p class="experience-description">
              During the whole training process, to prepare as best as possible
              for this competition, my school sent the team to other provinces
              to study with excellent Vietnamese teachers. This opportunity is
              valuable because I can gain knowledge from many sources outside of
              my school. Therefore, before each class led by these teachers, I
              usually complete all the problems, allowing me to discuss such
              challenging exercises in more depth in tutorial classes.
            </p>
            <p class="experience-description">
              After 2.5 months of practice, I entered the competition with the
              highest spirit. Luckily, I won a consolation prize. That award was
              meaningful to me because it proves that I would succeed if I put
              in as much effort as possible. I dare to challenge myself to study
              hard, open the society to discuss with more excellent students.
              Moreover, the valuable knowledge that I gained from the practise
              should be the best foundation for preparing for the upcoming
              competition next year.
            </p>
            <p class="experience-description">
              This experience allowed me to hone my self-studying skills.
              Although lecturers and friends helped me a lot, I still had to do
              most problems by myself. The skills I gained, including planning a
              curriculum for the self-studying progress, allocating time
              suitably for this work, etc., are crucial steps for me to engage
              in any working environment. I also had the chance to build a
              relationship with senior students, who were always ready to point
              out my weakness in the physics problem-solving ability. I believe
              these experiences will be high-quality training for me to go
              further steps in my life and ace the challenges I have to
              encounter in the future.
